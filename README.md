# PyTorch Tutorial for Physics-informed Machine Learning

This repository contains several key models in Physice-informed machine learning (PI-ML) and data-driven machine learning written in PyTorch. 

## Data-driven models
* Neural Network (NN)
  - Standard fully connected neural networks
* Multi-fidelity Neural Network (MFNN)
  - Three standard neural networks coupled to fit high-fidelity data, high-fidelity data and their linear combination.
* Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
  - Convolutional neural network(Decoder)

## Physics-informed Machine Learning (PIML)
* Physical-informed Neural Networks (PINNs)
  - Physical-informed neural network for solving partial differential equations, e.g., Allen-Cahn equation(1D time-dependent and 2D equilibrium state)
* Deep Operator Networks (DeepONet)
  - DeepONet for learning a PDE operator   

## Proof of Concept are listed below:
* DynNet (Dynamic-graph Network)
  - Fully-connected neural network to demonstrate the concept of dynamic graph.
* Gradient (Automatic Differentiation)
  - Calculate gradient in PyTorch
