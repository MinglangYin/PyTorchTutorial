# PyTorch Tutorial for Physics-informed Machine Learning
## This repository contains several key models in Physice-informed machine learning (PI-ML) and data-driven machine learning written in PyTorch. 

### Data-driven model
- NN (Neural Network)
  - Standard fully connected neural networks
- MFNN (Multi-fidelity Neural Network)
  - Three standard neural networks coupled to fit high-fidelity data, high-fidelity data and their linear combination.
- CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
  - Convolutional neural network(Decoder)

- PINNs (Physical-informed Neural Networks)
  - Physical-informed neural network for solving partial differential equations, e.g., Allen-Cahn equation(1D time-dependent and 2D equilibrium state)


Proof of Concept are listed below:
- DynNet (Dynamic-graph Network)
  - Fully-connected neural network to demonstrate the concept of dynamic graph.
- Gradient (Automatic Differentiation)
  - Calculate gradient in PyTorch
